26 Nov 2012 - version 2.1

 - Add support for multiple apps. It's possible to have 3 Ext.Application instances
   running with their own routes. Check tests/multi-app.html for an example.
 
 - Make Router compatible with namespaced controllers like 'users.Settings'. Before we were 
   auto-capitalizing every controller (user#index -> User controller) and it would break with
   namespaced controllers (wrong: users.Settings#index -> User.Settings).

 - Auto-parse arguments appended to the URL when they are not managed by the route. For example:
   extract params from 'users/1?name=Bruno&company=Sencha' with route 'users/:id', but not with
   'users/:id?*args'

Thanks to @zam6ak and @revolunet for bug reports and pull requests.
